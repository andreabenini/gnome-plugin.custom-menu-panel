# Gnome Custom Menu Panel
Custom menu on Gnome Top Bar with your favorite program shortcuts.
Basically a rewrite of an older application (QuickToggler) but compatible with gnome 40.

---

A Major rewrite is in progress, this is just an early beta, barely working but there's nothing more.
I'm still testing it, documentation on the road (see .entries.json on github).

# Gnome Custom Menu Panel
Custom menu on Gnome Top Bar with your favorite program shortcuts.
Basically a rewrite of an older application (QuickToggler) but compatible with gnome 40.

---

A Major rewrite is in progress, this is the first version it's barely working but there's nothing more.
Documentation is still a work in progress (see examples and .entries.json on github).

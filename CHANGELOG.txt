2025-09 v4.2.2
        - FIX:    Code evaluation and major rewrite, this plugin has lost its pace and it's quite outdated for
               current gnome versions. Adapting sources to match new Gnome 48 structures and data types

2023-08 v4.2.1
        - FIX: Status toggler widget wasn't checked on startup, now this item uses 'detector' property for it.
               Detector command should return exit_status for a proper toggle setting:
                       0 : Menu toggle ON  on startup
                       1 : Menu toggle OFF on startup

2025-09 v5.0.1
        - MAJOR:  Project registered and available for download from https://extensions.gnome.org,
                  search "custom menu" in the gnome extensions marketplace, it will come out as the
                  FIRST result. Just install it from official Gnome Extensions website.
        - FIX:    Removing incompatible gnome versions according to new gnome base classes. Fixed
                  metadata.json manifest file to properly match what latest Gnome versions require
        - FIX:    Garbage collector and automated tests. When the extension is disabled it won't waste
                  memory and no js stale variables around. Minimal footprint without gnome registry
                  presence, configuration is totally self contained in the entries.json file
        - ADD:    Adding new object types:
                        - 'systemd': for managing systemd services
                        - 'tmux': for dealing with tmux sessions

2023-08 v4.2.1
        - FIX: Status toggler widget wasn't checked on startup, now this item uses 'detector' property for it.
               Detector command should return exit_status for a proper toggle setting:
                       0 : Menu toggle ON  on startup
                       1 : Menu toggle OFF on startup
